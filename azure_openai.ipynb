I was curious to learn some basic concepts and get inspired by what\\'s possible to build, not just in software but also in the physical world. I want to emphasize that my current goal is not to pursue robotics at a deep level, it\\'s simply to expose myself to the basic concepts so I can develop my intuitions for the field.\\nAs I wrap up the course, I wanted to share my thoughts on how learning robotics has been valuable for my developer journey, especially in this age of AI.\\nBefore I share my thoughts, some context for those interested in what the kit is about. The course included in the kit consists of a series of Arduino projects that gradually build upon each other with clear explanations, schematics, and code examples. The projects ranged from powering a single LED to setting up more complex systems involving motors and IR sensors.\\nHere is a photo of me tinkering away. In my head, I felt like Tony Stark. The reality was far more humble... But hey, you have to start somewhere!\\nMy thoughts after completing this course:\\nIt strengthens core foundations.\\nPursuing robotics requires you to engage with mathematics, physics, and electronics in a concrete manner. These foundations build thinking patterns that are useful for software engineering.\\nIt helps build intuitions for working with non-deterministic systems just like AI systems.\\nRobotic systems don\\'t always behave predictably. Sensors introduce noise. Motors behave inconsistently. Timing matters. Multiple variables interact simultaneously. Continuous feedback loops (observe, decide, act) are central for robotic systems. We are increasingly seeing these feedback loops in AI systems, especially agentic workflows.\\nIt develops systems-level thinking.\\nAn increasingly valued skill for software engineers in the age of AI is the ability to reason with systems such as control systems, embedded systems, feedback systems. Robotics helps develop intuitions around building systems.\\nIt feels very tangible.\\nThe software you write translates into physical movement, sound, light. This is very satisfying to experience.\\nIt\\'s simply fun.  Maybe I should have just started with this point. If you like building things you will find this entertaining. Sometimes that\\'s all you need to pursue something.\\nRobotics reminded me that great engineers don’t just understand code. They understand systems. And in the age of AI, systems thinking is becoming one of the most valuable skills we can develop.\\nDiscussions\\nHave you explored robotics as a software engineer?\\nDid it change how you think about systems, software, or AI?\\nCurious to hear from both robotics engineers and software engineers who have explored this path.\\nTop comments  (33)\\nSubscribe\\nPersonal\\nTrusted User\\nCreate template\\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\\nSubmit\\nPreview\\nDismiss\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nMaame Afua A.

It reminds me so much of my high school days in a robotics social club. We spent so many afternoons huddled over messy wires and debugging motors that just wouldn\\'t turn when we wanted them to. That \"Tony Stark\" feeling you mentioned is so real until you realize your sensor is just picking up a stray reflection and the whole logic falls apart!\\nLike comment:\\nLike comment:\\n4 \\xa0likes\\nLike\\nComment button\\nReply\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nJulien Avezou\\nJulien Avezou\\nJulien Avezou\\nFollow\\nEntrepreneur | Software Engineer | Co-creator of daily-jots.com\\nLocation\\nToronto, Canada\\nEducation\\nUniversity of Warwick\\nPronouns\\nhe/him\\nWork\\nJots\\nJoined\\nJun 4, 2025\\n•\\nFeb 11\\nDropdown menu\\nCopy link\\nHide\\nNice that this post took you back.

Both fields reward iterative, feedback-driven development. I have been building an AI companion bot on Telegram ( @adola2048_bot ) and the debugging process is surprisingly similar to robotics - you observe behavior, adjust parameters, and re-test in the real environment. Simulation only gets you so far.\\nLike comment:\\nLike comment:\\n3 \\xa0likes\\nLike\\nComment button\\nReply\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nJulien Avezou\\nJulien Avezou\\nJulien Avezou\\nFollow\\nEntrepreneur | Software Engineer | Co-creator of daily-jots.com\\nLocation\\nToronto, Canada\\nEducation\\nUniversity of Warwick\\nPronouns\\nhe/him\\nWork\\nJots\\nJoined\\nJun 4, 2025\\n•\\nFeb 11\\nDropdown menu\\nCopy link\\nHide\\nExactly!

That kind of exposure builds instincts you simply don’t develop when everything runs in a predictable software environment.\\nIn many ways, working with robotics feels closer to working with AI systems than traditional app development. It strengthens systems thinking - and I agree, that’s becoming one of the most valuable skills in this era.\\nLike comment:\\nLike comment:\\n2 \\xa0likes\\nLike\\nComment button\\nReply\\nCollapse\\nExpand\\nJulien Avezou\\nJulien Avezou\\nJulien Avezou\\nFollow\\nEntrepreneur | Software Engineer | Co-creator of daily-jots.com\\nLocation\\nToronto, Canada\\nEducation\\nUniversity of Warwick\\nPronouns\\nhe/him\\nWork\\nJots\\nJoined\\nJun 4, 2025\\n•\\nFeb 11\\nDropdown menu\\nCopy link\\nHide\\nThanks!
